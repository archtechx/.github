# ArchTech

üëã Hey! This is the GitHub organization of [ArchTech](https://archte.ch).

We are a web development agency that specializes in Laravel and, primarily, the [TALLstack](https://tallstack.dev).

Aside from client work, a major focus of ours is creating advanced tooling for the Laravel ecosystem.

## Open-source

Our main open-source project is [Tenancy for Laravel](https://tenancyforlaravel.com).

Aside from that, we have a bunch of mini packages, like: [`laravel-seo`](https://archte.ch/gh/laravel-seo),
[`laravel-pages`](https://archte.ch/gh/laravel-pages), [`livewire-access`](https://archte.ch/gh/livewire-access),
[`money`](https://archte.ch/gh/money), and [many more](https://github.com/orgs/archtechx/repositories).

In 2022, we'll be releasing our [e-commerce package](https://laravel-news.com/archtech-ecommerce-package) and most importantly: [Lean Admin](https://lean-admin.dev), a game-changing admin panel framework for Laravel.

## Projects

We run a tech-stack specific job board: [StackJobs](https://stackjobs.dev). The point of it is to make it easy for TALL (Tailwind, Alpine, Laravel, Livewire)
and VITL (Vue, Inertia, Tailwind, Laravel) developers to find jobs, or for companies using those tech stacks to find developers. Later we'll be expanding the
selection of tech stacks, but right now we're focusing on the ones that are closest to the Laravel community.

[Laravel Code Tips](https://laravel-code.tips) is a project of ours that serves as an aggregate of code tips for Laravel developers. They're presented in
a way that has great UX and makes finding new tips easy.

## Content

We regularly post on our [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/archtechx) where we share üî• code tips, üí≠ general thoughts on web development,
and üßµ weekly threads with Laravel updates.

We post ‚úçÔ∏è long form on our [blog](https://archte.ch/blog) and our [forum](https://forum.archte.ch).
